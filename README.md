## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from a retail store to discover business performance insights. The main goal is to evaluate operational and marketing metrics using a full data pipeline — from extraction to visualization — and a dynamic Power BI dashboard powered by DuckDB and SQL transformations.
The final goal is to support the CEO and CMO in making informed decisions by presenting revenue indicators, customer segments, return trends, and time-based performance based on transactional data of the fiscal year in question.

## Problem Statement
Retailers use to face the challenge of handling a large quantity of data without transforming it into business value. In this project, the company looks for:

- A deep understanding of revenue sources.
- Identification of top-performing products, customers, and countries.
- Clear metrics around returns and customer retention.
- A dashboard that provides both operational and marketing perspectives.

This project addresses those needs through an end-to-end pipeline and a data storytelling dashboard, made for executive decisions.
